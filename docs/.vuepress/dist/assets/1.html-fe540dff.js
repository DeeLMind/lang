Let&#39;s talk about it.</p><p>Have you ever wanted to sound just like Tom Cruise or Ellen DeGeneres or me? Well, the</p><p>only thing that I have in common with Tom Cruise and Ellen DeGeneres is that we speak</p><p>with a standard American accent. Today, you&#39;re going to learn what makes the standard American</p><p>accent different from other English accents and how you can start to speak like an American</p><p>yourself. To help you never forget what you&#39;re going to learn today, I&#39;ve created a free</p><p>PDF worksheet with all of the American English pronunciation points, sample sentences, and</p><p>you can answer a Vanessa&#39;s Challenge question at the end of the worksheets. Click on the</p><p>link in the description to download the free PDF today.</p><p>In today&#39;s lesson, you&#39;ll see three of my most popular American English videos that</p><p>I made many years ago, but they are revived for you today. The first 20 minutes will be</p><p>an American English speaking practice where you can practice pronunciation and speaking</p><p>out loud, like an American. And the final 10 minutes of this lesson will be some bonus</p><p>idioms that only Americans use, and you can too. All right, let&#39;s get started.</p><p>Have you ever been watching an American movie and thought, &quot;Oh, it would be great if I could</p><p>sound like Tom Cruise.&quot; Or maybe you&#39;ve watched one of my videos already and thought, &quot;Mmm,</p><p>I would love to sound like Vanessa.&quot; Well, today I&#39;m going to give you some tips to help</p><p>you make your pronunciation sound more like an American. And by American, I mean the United</p><p>States of America. There are a couple things that we need to</p><p>talk about first though. What in the world is an American accent? Because a lot of people</p><p>in the US have different styles of speaking. Here, I&#39;m going to be explaining how to sound</p><p>like the most general American accent, which is that of news reporters or Hollywood. When</p><p>you think about Tom Cruise, this is the accent that I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m not talking about</p><p>a New York accent, a Southern accent, a California accent. I&#39;m talking about standard American</p><p>English. Of course, if you want to sound more American,</p><p>you need to use American expressions instead of British or Australian expressions. So if</p><p>you would like to know some differences between these expressions, make sure you check out</p><p>the playlist that I&#39;ll link here and in the description.</p><p>And finally, the best way to improve your pronunciation to sound more American, or if</p><p>you want to sound more British or Australian, is to shadow. And this means you&#39;re imitating</p><p>word for word everything that that person is saying. You&#39;re repeating directly after</p><p>the speaker. I have a couple videos where I explain the shadowing technique, so be sure</p><p>to click there or in the description to check out those videos.</p><p>But it&#39;s also great to be able to break down the sounds of a language. And that&#39;s what</p><p>I&#39;m going to do today is talk about four important concepts that you need to include in your</p><p>speaking if you want to sound more American. Are you ready? The first way that you can</p><p>sound more American is to change your T sounds to D sounds when they&#39;re between two vowels.</p><p>Let&#39;s listen to a sentence that uses a lot of these.</p><p>Dan: In New York City, he wore an exciting sweater</p><p>because that always made him satisfied. In New York City, he wore an exciting sweater</p><p>because that always made him satisfied. Vanessa:</p><p>City. Exciting. Sweater. Here, we have a T between two vowel sounds like I mentioned,</p><p>and it&#39;s changing to a D. It&#39;s not a t- sound. It is d-. This also happens between words.</p><p>So you heard &quot;that always, that always.&quot; This isn&#39;t always done, but it&#39;s often done when</p><p>native speakers are talking quickly. We link together words by making the final T change</p><p>into a D. That always. Oh, so this can be used in a lot of different</p><p>situations. A couple years ago, I had a British friend who I always teased because whenever</p><p>I asked him to speak in an American accent, the only thing he would say is &quot;water bottle,</p><p>water bottle, water bottle,&quot; again, and again and again. And it was so funny because it</p><p>really is the perfect example of an American accent. It uses the T changing to a D. Water</p><p>bottle, and it also uses one more concept that we&#39;re going to talk about a little bit</p><p>later in this video. So now I want to give you a chance to practice</p><p>this pronunciation, T changing to a D. We&#39;re going to listen to that clip one more time</p><p>of that sample sentence. And then there&#39;s going to be a pause. I want you to read that</p><p>sentence and try to imitate, try to shadow that pronunciation. Are you ready to use your</p><p>speaking muscles? Let&#39;s do it. Dan:</p><p>In New York City, he wore an exciting sweater because that always made him satisfied.</p><p>(silence) Vanessa:</p><p>The second way to sound more American when you speak is to use the colored R. What in</p><p>the world is that? Well, it&#39;s in the middle of the word. When there is an R plus a consonant,</p><p>a consonant is any letter that&#39;s not A E I O U. So it might be R S, R D. Any word that</p><p>has an R plus a consonant. It&#39;s going to sound like, er, er. Let&#39;s listen to a sample sentence</p><p>that uses this a lot. Dan:</p><p>The first word that you learned is the one you heard the most. The first word that you</p><p>learned is the one you heard the most. Vanessa:</p><p>Did you notice something in this sentence? There are a lot of different vowel sounds</p><p>that change to sound like one sound, er. In the word &quot;first,&quot; there is an I. In the word</p><p>&quot;word,&quot; there is an O. In the word &quot;heard&quot; and &quot;learned&quot; there&#39;s E A, but they all sound</p><p>like er, er. This is the colored R, and it&#39;s really typical in American English. Er. Heard.</p><p>Let&#39;s listen to that clip again. And the same as before, I want you to try to imitate and</p><p>shadow that pronunciation style. Test your pronunciation muscles. Try to sound like an</p><p>angry dog. First, word, learned. It sounds a little crazy when you&#39;re practicing. But</p><p>of course, when you&#39;re speaking with other people, you can tone it down, but it&#39;s good</p><p>to exaggerate when you&#39;re practicing pronunciation because you&#39;re getting your muscles prepared.</p><p>And then when they&#39;re already ready to use those sounds, it will feel more natural. Your</p><p>muscles will know where to go, and then you can kind of tone it down and not sound so</p><p>crazy when you&#39;re speaking with other people. So when you&#39;re practicing, don&#39;t worry about</p><p>exaggerating. The first word that I learned. Take it easy, try it yourself. And let&#39;s listen</p><p>and pause. And it&#39;s your turn to speak. Dan:</p><p>The first word that you learned is the one you heard the most.</p><p>(silence) Vanessa:</p><p>My next tip for sounding American is to include an E-R at the end of your words. Er. This</p><p>is really typical in American English. So before I explain it any further, let&#39;s listen</p><p>to a sentence that includes this a couple times.</p><p>Dan: In the letter he wrote, remember to water</p><p>the flowers. In the letter he wrote, remember to water the flowers.</p><p>Vanessa: When my British friend was saying &quot;water bottle,&quot;</p><p>this was the second American sound that he was using. The E-R at the end of the word,</p><p>er. Water. Don&#39;t forget to water the flowers. Remember to water the flowers. And this is</p><p>going to really test your R pronunciation. We used it in the previous tip and now we&#39;re</p><p>using it, er, again. You really need to make sure your R&#39;s are strong and powerful. Remember</p><p>to water the flowers. All right, let&#39;s listen to that clip one more time. And then we&#39;re</p><p>going to pause and I want you to say it out loud.</p><p>Dan: In the letter he wrote, remember to water</p><p>the flowers. (silence)</p><p>Vanessa: My fourth and final tip is a specific contrast</p><p>with British English. It is the ending A-R-Y. Again, we&#39;re talking about R, because R is</p><p>essential in English and it&#39;s essential in a lot of different languages. I think oftentimes</p><p>the R is the most challenging sound in other languages because it&#39;s so integral. Well,</p><p>in this case, A-R-Y at the end of words is going to indicate that in American English</p><p>we&#39;re going to pronounce the full word library, secretary, military. Do you hear that ending?</p><p>Ary, ary, ary. Library. Whew! We&#39;re going to say the full word. Let&#39;s listen to a quick</p><p>sentence that uses a couple of these examples. Dan:</p><p>At the library, the secretary read a book about the military. At the library, the secretary</p><p>read a book about the military. Vanessa:</p><p>In American English, you&#39;re going to pronounce each of the final letters, A-R-Y. Military.</p><p>In British English, they often cut out the A, so instead of military, it would be military.</p><p>Military. That A is just gone. But in American English, each of those letters are pronounced.</p><p>Military. Ary. So let&#39;s listen to this clip one more time. And then I want to pause and</p><p>let you have a chance to repeat the sentence yourself.</p><p>Dan: At the library, the secretary read a book</p><p>about the military. (silence)</p><p>Vanessa: So how did you do with these American English</p><p>pronunciation sentences? Did you challenge your pronunciation? Do you think that you</p><p>can sound more American after watching this video? I hope that these tips are useful to</p><p>you, and let me know in the comments below. Are there any other words that you can use</p><p>to sound more American using these four tips? Let me know, and I hope that you enjoyed this</p><p>lesson. I&#39;ll see you the next time. Have you ever wondered, is the American accent</p><p>really different from the British accent? The answer is oh, yes, definitely. Last year</p><p>I made this video that has now over a million and a half views. It&#39;s called Four Secrets</p><p>to the American English Accent. And in this video, we talked about the four essential</p><p>elements of the American English accent. But today I think it&#39;s time to go beyond those</p><p>basics and dig a little deeper. Are you ready? We&#39;re going to be practicing</p><p>four more secrets to the American English accent, and after each section, I want you</p><p>to try to imitate and shadow exactly with my voice. That means that you need to practice,</p><p>and it&#39;s a great way to improve your pronunciation. Let&#39;s get started.</p><p>The first secret to an American English accent is the stopped T. Hmm. This is super common.</p><p>It&#39;s when there is a T at the end of a word, but we don&#39;t exactly say it. Let me give you</p><p>a quick example. How about the word &quot;right?&quot; Did you hear &quot;righ-t?&quot; Nope. Instead, when</p><p>I said that final T my tongue was stopped at the top of my mouth. That&#39;s why we call</p><p>it a stopped T. Right. Right. Let&#39;s look at a sample sentence.</p><p>I thought he wouldn&#39;t appreciate the plant. There&#39;s a lot of words here that end in T,</p><p>or have a T close to the end. Listen carefully again. Do you hear any of those T&#39;s?</p><p>I thought he wouldn&#39;t appreciate the plant. For each of those T&#39;s, my tongue is stopped</p><p>at the top of my mouth. Let&#39;s look at another sample sentence.</p><p>I bought some meat and took it outside. Almost each of these words that end in T have</p><p>a stopped T. Let&#39;s listen one more time. I bought some meat and took it outside.</p><p>The word &quot;outside&quot; has a T in the middle, but because this word is kind of two words</p><p>put together, out and side, we&#39;re going to have a stopped T here in the middle. This</p><p>is a little bit of an exception. All right, let&#39;s go back to that original sentence, and</p><p>I want you to try to say it out loud with me. Now that you&#39;ve heard a lot of different</p><p>examples, I want you to speak out loud, use those pronunciation muscles and speak. Are</p><p>you ready? I thought he wouldn&#39;t appreciate the plant.</p><p>I thought. Is your tongue stopped at the top of your mouth? I hope so.</p><p>I thought he wouldn&#39;t appreciate the plant. You know what I&#39;m going to do? I&#39;m going to</p><p>pause and I want you to say the sentence all by yourself. No matter where you are, I&#39;ll</p><p>be listening. So make sure you speak out loud. Go ahead.</p><p>(silence) Great work.</p><p>All right. Let&#39;s go on to the second secret of having an American English accent. Number</p><p>two is the glottal T. Oh, we&#39;re talking about the letter T again. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of comments</p><p>about how to pronounce the word &quot;sentence.&quot; Sentence, or sentence? Ooh, I say &quot;sentence.&quot;</p><p>And I&#39;ve gotten so many comments of people saying, &quot;Vanessa, why do you pronounce it</p><p>like that? How did you say that?&quot; Well, this is a lovely concept called the glottal T.</p><p>Glottal, glottis, is kind of a scientific term for something in your throat. I don&#39;t</p><p>think I can scientifically explain it, but listen to these words and see if you can hear</p><p>my throat stopping the T in the middle of the word. Listen carefully.</p><p>The winner of the international Winter Olympics has gotten an important award on the internet.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of T&#39;s in the middle of words. Let&#39;s break down the sentence a little bit.</p><p>There are two different ways to have the glottal T. The first one is with an N-T. So for example,</p><p>the words &quot;international,&quot; &quot;winter,&quot; &quot;internet,&quot; &quot;sentence.&quot; In these words, the T is just</p><p>gone. So here we have an N-T, usually plus a vowel. And you&#39;re going to say &quot;sentence.&quot;</p><p>You can say sentence with a T. It&#39;s fine, but you&#39;re going to hear native speakers,</p><p>when we&#39;re speaking quickly, you&#39;re going to hear us completely cut out that T. Sentence.</p><p>Winter. International. Internet. The other way to use the glottal T is with</p><p>words that have a T in the middle, not necessarily an N-T, but have a t in the middle. Sometimes</p><p>the double T, sometimes it&#39;s not. For example the words, &quot;button,&quot; &quot;gotten,&quot; &quot;eaten,&quot; &quot;important.&quot;</p><p>Do you notice that my throat is stopping that T sound in the middle of the word? Listen</p><p>again, &quot;button,&quot; &quot;eaten,&quot; &quot;gotten,&quot; &quot;important.&quot; Here, my throat is doing some important work</p><p>here to make that glottal T sound exactly the way it should.</p><p>Before we practice that sample sentence, sentence again, I want to share what I found when I</p><p>was doing a little bit of research about where this glottal T came from. I found on Wikipedia</p><p>that it was first mentioned in Scotland in the 1800&#39;s and a dialect worker who was doing</p><p>some research about different dialects said, &quot;It&#39;s considered a lazy habit and may have</p><p>been in the dialect for hundreds of years.&quot; So it&#39;s possible that Americans got this glottal</p><p>T from Scotland, possibly. I don&#39;t know, but in any case, it is kind of considered a lazy</p><p>habit, but Americans have picked up a lot of that in our natural way of speaking.</p><p>Okay, let&#39;s go back to that sample sentence. And I&#39;m going to say it a couple times. Please</p><p>say it with me because I&#39;m going to pause and you&#39;re going to have to say it all by</p><p>yourself. So let&#39;s practice together. The winner of the international Winter Olympics</p><p>has gotten an important award on the internet. Let&#39;s say it one more time.</p><p>The winner of the international Winter Olympics has gotten an important award on the internet.</p><p>Okay. I&#39;m going to pause and I want you to try to say this glottal T all by yourself.</p><p>Go ahead. (silence)</p><p>Great work. All right. Let&#39;s go on to the third secret of having an American English</p><p>accent. Number three, contractions with &quot;will.&quot; There are two ways to pronounce contractions</p><p>with &quot;will.&quot; There is a clear way, and then there&#39;s a relaxed way. Let&#39;s look at a quick</p><p>example. Let&#39;s take the words &quot;you will.&quot; If we want to make a contraction with this,</p><p>we could say Y-O-U apostrophe L-L. How can we pronounce this? Well, you could say it</p><p>in a clear way. You&#39;ll. Do you hear the full word? You, you&#39;ll. Yeah, yeah. I&#39;m saying</p><p>you and then, l-. Just the L-L at the end. But what if we want to say this in a relaxed,</p><p>maybe lazy way? Well, instead you can say you&#39;ll, you&#39;ll. You&#39;re only saying kind of</p><p>like, Y-U-L-L. You&#39;ll, you&#39;ll. Let&#39;s look at another example. This is kind</p><p>of a crazy sentence, but it uses this concept a lot. First, I&#39;m going to say in the clear</p><p>way, and then we&#39;re going to say it in the relaxed way.</p><p>He&#39;ll go if you&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll go if we&#39;ll go.</p><p>In each of these contractions, you heard that full pronoun. He, you, they, we. But let&#39;s</p><p>look at it when it&#39;s relaxed and this is going to help you sound a little bit more natural,</p><p>like in American English speaker. He&#39;ll go if you&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll go if we&#39;ll</p><p>go. In all of these, there&#39;s an l- sound. He&#39;ll</p><p>go if you&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll go if we&#39;ll go. I didn&#39;t say we&#39;ll go. I just said the first</p><p>letter, W, plus U-L-L. We&#39;ll, we&#39;ll. Let&#39;s go through each of the contractions that use</p><p>&quot;will&quot; so that you can hear this in a natural way and in a sentence.</p><p>You&#39;ll. You&#39;ll get the car. He&#39;ll. He&#39;ll get the car. She&#39;ll. She&#39;ll get the car. We&#39;ll.</p><p>We&#39;ll get the car. They&#39;ll. They&#39;ll get the car. Let&#39;s say that sample sentence one more</p><p>time together. I want you to speak out loud and then you&#39;ll have a chance to say it by</p><p>yourself. He&#39;ll go if we&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll go if you&#39;ll</p><p>go. He&#39;ll go if we&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll go if you&#39;ll go.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s your turn to say it by yourself. Go ahead.</p><p>(silence) Excellent work. Let&#39;s go on to the fourth</p><p>and final secret of having an American English accent. Number four is linking the S plus</p><p>a vowel. Listen to this sentence. How&#39;s it going? How&#39;s it going?</p><p>What about this sentence? There are cars in the sun. There are cars in the sun.</p><p>Both of these sentences have an S and then a vowel. What happens here? In each of these</p><p>words, the S becomes a Z. How&#39;s it going? There are cars in the sun.&quot; Common words that</p><p>we use this with are &quot;it,&quot; how&#39;s it going? And also &quot;in,&quot; there are cars in the sun.</p><p>That&#39;s probably the most common ways that you&#39;re going to see this. So let&#39;s take a</p><p>look at a couple sentences. He&#39;s in the office. He&#39;s in the office. He&#39;s</p><p>in the office. She goes in the theater. She goes in the theater.</p><p>When he complains, it gets on my nerves. When he complains, it gets on my nerves.</p><p>Do you see how, when we link here, it helps you to speak a little more quickly. And when</p><p>you link it together with a Z, it sounds so natural. Don&#39;t go to the cliffs. It&#39;s too</p><p>dangerous. If we have a pause here, you could just say an S don&#39;t go to the cliffs. It&#39;s</p><p>too dangerous. But if you say this quickly, and that&#39;s kind of our key here, then you&#39;re</p><p>going to link it together with Z. Don&#39;t go to the cliffs, it&#39;s too dangerous. Cliffs,</p><p>it&#39;s too dangerous. All right, let&#39;s say together those two original sentences, please say it</p><p>with me, use those pronunciation muscles, and then I&#39;m going to pause so that you can</p><p>have a chance to say it all by yourself. How&#39;s it going? How&#39;s it going?</p><p>There are cars in the sun. There are cars in the sun.</p><p>Okay? Now it&#39;s your turn. Say it all by yourself. You got this.</p><p>(silence). Great work. That was a lot of pronunciation</p><p>practice. But before we go, let&#39;s do a quick review. If you&#39;d like to say these sentences</p><p>out loud with me, please do that. That&#39;s the best way to improve your pronunciation and</p><p>also just to remember these concepts. I thought he wouldn&#39;t appreciate the plant.</p><p>The winner of the international Winter Olympics has gotten an important award on the internet.</p><p>He&#39;ll go if we&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll go if you&#39;ll go.</p><p>How&#39;s it going? There are cars in the sun.</p><p>And now I have a question for you. In the comments, let me know what is something that&#39;s</p><p>really important to you? I want you to use this word &quot;important&quot; because in the middle</p><p>we have that glottal T. Import- and then at the end we have a stopped T. Important. There&#39;s</p><p>no T that we actually speak at the end. So if you can say your sample sentence that you</p><p>write in the comments out loud, that will be beautiful practice. You can read each other&#39;s</p><p>sentences as well to see what kind of things are important to people all around the world.</p><p>You might be wondering, what in the world is an American idiom? Well, these idioms might</p><p>be understood by people in the UK, but they&#39;re most often used by Americans. And if you said</p><p>one of these to someone from the US they would instantly understand what you meant, and they</p><p>wouldn&#39;t feel weird at all like you were using an expression that they hadn&#39;t heard very</p><p>often. For each of these idioms, I&#39;m going to tell you a little story, and I want you</p><p>to guess what you think the idiom means based on the context.</p><p>So for our first idiom, I want to tell you a quick story about last week. One of my friends</p><p>who has a small baby, we were going to get together. And in the morning when we were</p><p>about to get together, she called me and said, &quot;Hey, Vanessa, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve got to take</p><p>a rain check because my baby is not feeling too well, so I want to just relax at home</p><p>and maybe we can get together next week.&quot; What do you think this idiom, &quot;take a rain</p><p>check&quot; means? Take a rain check. Think about it for a moment.</p><p>In this context, we were going to get together, but we needed to change some plans because</p><p>her baby wasn&#39;t feeling well. That&#39;s exactly what this idiom means. Change your plans.</p><p>We need to delay or just push back our plans because something happened. Maybe you just</p><p>are feeling tired or you&#39;re feeling sick, so you need to change your plans. You could</p><p>say, &quot;I need to take a rain check,&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s take a rain check and do our event next week.&quot;</p><p>Let&#39;s take a rain check. It&#39;s easy to remember this expression if you</p><p>can remember the base word rain. Let&#39;s imagine you&#39;re trying to have some kind of event outside.</p><p>Maybe you&#39;re trying to get married outside like I was, and it rains like it was on my</p><p>wedding. Well, you can&#39;t have the event outside. You have to go inside. So you need to change</p><p>your plans because of the weather. So this is kind of the origin of the expression, but</p><p>we can use it in any situation where you&#39;re changing plans.</p><p>The second American idiom is &quot;to shoot the breeze.&quot; Let me tell you a quick story so</p><p>you can guess the meaning. In a couple days, I&#39;m getting together with a childhood friend</p><p>who I haven&#39;t seen for a while. And when I told my husband that I was going to get together</p><p>with her, he said, &quot;What are you going to do? You haven&#39;t seen her for a long time.&quot;</p><p>And I said, &quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know. Shoot the breeze. Just sit together, we&#39;ll figure out</p><p>something.&quot; What do you think from this quick story that</p><p>&quot;shoot the breeze&quot; means? Well, we can imagine the word &quot;breeze&quot; means a small wind. We can</p><p>imagine a breeze coming out of your mouth when you&#39;re talking. So, shooting the breeze</p><p>means just to chit chat together, to talk about daily life, nothing too deep or important,</p><p>just to chat. So I said, &quot;I&#39;m going to just shoot the breeze with her.&quot; I&#39;m not going</p><p>to take a gun and shoot the wind. That would be a pretty crazy activity together. But instead</p><p>we just talked. So there was wind coming out of our mouths, breeze. And this means we didn&#39;t</p><p>really talk about anything serious or substantial, just chit chat, just chatted.</p><p>The third American idiom is &quot;to plead the fifth.&quot; Let me tell you a quick story so you</p><p>can guess what it means. Let&#39;s imagine that your friend comes over to your house. And</p><p>he says, &quot;Oh man, I just went on a date with Sarah yesterday. It was so great.&quot; And then</p><p>you say, &quot;Oh, did you kiss her?&quot; And he might say, &quot;I plead the fifth.&quot; What does this mean?</p><p>Why did he say &quot;I plead the fifth?&quot; Well, the word &quot;plead&quot; means I beg, &quot;Please, please,</p><p>I&#39;m begging.&quot; And &quot;the fifth,&quot; what in the world is the fifth? Why not the fourth? The</p><p>10th? Why is there a number here? Well, this is referencing the Constitution of the United</p><p>States. In the constitution, the Fifth Amendment says you don&#39;t need to say anything that is</p><p>going to incriminate you in court. But when your friend was talking to you about kissing</p><p>a girl on a date, was he worried about going to court or going to jail? No.</p><p>So let&#39;s talk about the original meaning of this expression, the political meaning and</p><p>then we&#39;ll talk about how it got interpreted in daily conversation. Well, let&#39;s imagine</p><p>that you&#39;re driving really fast and a policeman pulls you over and you roll down your window.</p><p>And he says, &quot;Excuse me, have you been drinking alcohol? Have you been smoking weed? Have</p><p>you been doing drugs?&quot; You could say, &quot;I plead the fifth.&quot; And this means, you know that</p><p>it&#39;s the law. You don&#39;t have to say anything to him that could make you get in trouble</p><p>with the court later. If he&#39;s going to take you to court, you&#39;re going to say it in the</p><p>court. You&#39;re not going to say it in this informal area in your car. You want to make</p><p>sure that there&#39;s a lawyer. You want to make sure that it is done the right way. So you</p><p>could say, &quot;I plead the fifth,&quot; because that Fifth Amendment of the constitution says you</p><p>don&#39;t need to answer his questions. You don&#39;t need to say that.</p><p>In daily life, we often use this when we don&#39;t want to answer a question. So you asked your</p><p>friend, &quot;Did you kiss her?&quot; And he said, &quot;I plead the fifth.&quot; This means he doesn&#39;t want</p><p>to answer your question. He doesn&#39;t say &quot;Legally, I don&#39;t have to answer your question.&quot; No,</p><p>this is just colloquially. He&#39;s saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to answer your question.&quot;</p><p>But there is a subtle meaning here. When you use this in daily conversation, it means &quot;I</p><p>don&#39;t want to tell you, but your answer is correct.&quot; So he said, &quot;Did you kiss her?&quot;</p><p>And he said, &quot;I plead the fifth.&quot; Really, it means &quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t want to tell you.&quot;</p><p>So if you use this expression, you&#39;re not really hiding the truth. You&#39;re telling them</p><p>what they already know, but you just don&#39;t want to say it.</p><p>So let me give you one other quick situation. The other day I was sneakily eating a piece</p><p>of chocolate in the kitchen. And Dan, my husband, walked into the kitchen and said, &quot;Did you</p><p>eat the last piece of chocolate?&quot; Well, I had eaten the last piece of chocolate and</p><p>I said, &quot;I plead the fifth.&quot; And this means I don&#39;t want to tell you, but it&#39;s true. I</p><p>did eat the last piece of chocolate. So even though I didn&#39;t say &quot;I ate the last piece,&quot;</p><p>yes, you are correct. It is implied when you use this expression. If you use it with a</p><p>police officer, he&#39;s going to be suspicious because you&#39;re not answering his question,</p><p>but this is the legal situation, so it&#39;s okay to use it. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Yes, I was drinking</p><p>alcohol. Yes, I was smoking. Yes. I was doing drugs.&quot; No, it doesn&#39;t imply that in the legal</p><p>situation, but in the colloquial situation, it does. It implies, &quot;Yes, I did that thing</p><p>that you&#39;re accusing me of, but I don&#39;t want to say it.&quot;</p><p>The fourth American idiom is &quot;to give props to someone.&quot; Let me tell you a quick story.</p><p>Let&#39;s imagine that you want to study abroad in the US and you&#39;d like to get your Master&#39;s</p><p>degree at Harvard. Well, your goal is to get your Master&#39;s degree, but you think, &quot;Why</p><p>not? I&#39;m going to try to apply to Harvard because they have a great reputation.&quot; So</p><p>you try to get into Harvard and you don&#39;t make it. Then your friend asks you, &quot;Hey,</p><p>how did it go? Did you get a reply? Did you make it into Harvard?&quot; And you probably say,</p><p>&quot;Mm, no, I didn&#39;t make it.&quot; They would say to you, &quot;Well, I give you props for trying.&quot;</p><p>What does this mean? I give you props for trying. This expression, &quot;props,&quot; means proper</p><p>respect, but it&#39;s just been shortened over time. And if you ask most Americans, &quot;What</p><p>does props mean?&quot; They probably wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you. I just looked it up online</p><p>because I was curious. But we can imagine from this full expression,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m giving you my proper respect for trying to get into Harvard. Even though you didn&#39;t</p><p>make it, you tried hard. I give you my respect.&quot; Well, we can shorten this expression to say,</p><p>&quot;I give you props for trying to get into Harvard.&quot; I give you props for something that you did.</p><p>So when you want to show that someone didn&#39;t succeed, but you still are respecting them</p><p>because they tried, this is a great expression to use.</p><p>And you know what? You can even give yourself props. So let&#39;s imagine that you see a lost</p><p>foreign traveler in your city, and you want to try to speak English with them, but you</p><p>feel a little nervous, but you do it anyway. You go to them, they ask you some questions.</p><p>You didn&#39;t understand everything, but you tried your best. You could say, &quot;Well, I give</p><p>myself props for trying. I give myself props for approaching them and trying to speak English.&quot;</p><p>You did it, maybe it wasn&#39;t perfect, but you tried. So you can use this as encouragement</p><p>for yourself. So now it&#39;s your turn. I want to know. Have</p><p>you ever needed to plead the fifth? Did you ever need to take a rain check or maybe give</p><p>props to someone?
