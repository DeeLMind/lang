Let&#39;s do it.</p><p>Do you have trouble finding someone to speak in English with? You know that you need to practice,</p><p>but ugh, you just can&#39;t find someone to speak with? Well, never fear. Today,</p><p>I have a great solution for you. My husband, Dan, and I have prepared</p><p>eight conversations about daily life. We are going to have a sample conversation, and then</p><p>it will be your turn to practice each of these eight conversations. I challenge you to watch our</p><p>sample conversation and then prepare your speaking muscles to answer my questions and speak out loud.</p><p>You can do it. And like always, I have created a free PDF worksheet for you,</p><p>which you can download in the description. It has all of the sample conversations. And you can write</p><p>out your own sentences for your conversations, but I highly recommend writing them out and then</p><p>reading them out loud, because the goal here is to practice speaking.</p><p>You can click on the link in the description to download that free PDF worksheet today. All right,</p><p>let&#39;s get started with our first conversation topic, which is vacation. You&#39;ll see the sample</p><p>conversation between Dan and I, and then it will be your turn to speak. Let&#39;s watch.</p><p>Hey, Dan. How&#39;s your week going? Dan:</p><p>Oh. It&#39;s going great. I just got back from a week at the beach.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh. Where&#39;d you go?</p><p>Dan: We went to Pawleys Island. My</p><p>family&#39;s been going there for years. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh. What do you like to do at the beach? Dan:</p><p>Just hang out at the beach, mostly. We play in the sand, build sand castles, read books. I love it.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh! Do you do that every year?</p><p>Dan: Yeah, we try to go over there every summer,</p><p>and sometimes for a holiday too. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh. Well, welcome back. Hey, how&#39;s your week going?</p><p>Oh. Great. Where&#39;d you go?</p><p>Oh. What do you like to do at the beach?</p><p>That sounds like a great vacation. Do you do that every year?</p><p>Oh, cool. Well, welcome back. Hey, Dan. You doing anything fun this weekend?</p><p>Dan: Yeah! I&#39;m going to be hanging out</p><p>with some friends from out of town. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh, that sounds great. What are you going to do? Dan:</p><p>Mostly just hang out, but we&#39;re going to go on a hike and then go to my favorite</p><p>restaurant. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh, what&#39;s your favorite restaurant? Dan:</p><p>It&#39;s an Asian fusion restaurant with great tacos and delicious kimchi.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh,</p><p>sounds wonderful. What else are you going to do? Dan:</p><p>Just walk around downtown and go to a few shops, grab a few beers at the local breweries.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh. I hope</p><p>you have a great time. Enjoy your weekend! Hey, are you doing anything fun this weekend?</p><p>Oh, that sounds fun. What are you going to do?</p><p>Cool. Where&#39;s your favorite place to go?</p><p>Well, that sounds fun.

I&#39;m learning a lot and</p><p>I really like the people I&#39;m working with. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh, what kind of work are you doing? Dan:</p><p>I work at an animal rescue clinic. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh. Dan:</p><p>And I take care of animals until they&#39;re ready to go to a permanent home.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, that sounds great. What got</p><p>you interested in that kind of work? Dan:</p><p>Well, I&#39;ve always loved animals, and this allows me to take care of animals all day long.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh. Well, what&#39;s the most</p><p>challenging part of that job? Dan:</p><p>Well, sometimes the animals are too sick to stay there, so we have to send them to</p><p>a different clinic. Vanessa:</p><p>That would be tough. But overall, sounds like a great job. Good luck.</p><p>Hey, how&#39;s your new job going?</p><p>Oh, that sounds good. What kind of work are you doing?</p><p>Oh, what got you interested in doing that?</p><p>What&#39;s the most challenging part of your job so far?</p><p>That sounds tough. But overall, it sounds like a great job. Good luck.</p><p>Hey, Dan. What you&#39;ve been watching lately? Dan:</p><p>Lately I&#39;ve been watching a murder mystery show. It&#39;s really great.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, what&#39;s it about?</p><p>Dan: Well, a man stumbles</p><p>upon a body in the woods and they&#39;re trying to figure out who it is and how it happened.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, what do you think&#39;s going to happen?</p><p>Dan: I don&#39;t know.</p><p>It could be a crazy accident or something darker. I&#39;ll have to keep watching to find out.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, sounds interesting. Maybe I&#39;ll have to watch</p><p>it too. Do you have any other recommendations? Dan:</p><p>I have a ton. I&#39;ll send them to you later. Vanessa:</p><p>Thanks so much. See you later. Hey, what have you been watching lately?</p><p>Oh, that sounds interesting. What&#39;s it about?

How are you feeling today?</p><p>Dan: Not so hot. I have a headache,</p><p>and I&#39;m really tired. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh, no. Have you taken anything for it? Dan:</p><p>No, not yet, but maybe I should. Vanessa:</p><p>Yeah. Can I get you some hot tea or soup? Dan:</p><p>That&#39;d be great. I&#39;d really appreciate it. Vanessa:</p><p>Yeah, or maybe I could give you some medicine or call the doctor and make an appointment for you.</p><p>Dan: That&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll call the doctor later</p><p>and see how he can help. Thank you though. Vanessa:</p><p>No problem. Well, I hope you feel better.

Well, I hope you feel better soon.</p><p>Hey, Dan. How was your get-together with your family? I know you were really looking forward</p><p>to it. Dan:</p><p>It was great. I got to grill out with my dad and all the kids got to run around and play,</p><p>and then at night the cousins got together and played cards. It was so much fun.</p><p>Vanessa: That sounds great. How many cousins do you have?</p><p>Dan: I have six cousins and they all have</p><p>two to three kids. You do the math. Vanessa:</p><p>Whoa. That is a big family. Do you see them often? Dan:</p><p>I see my immediate family a lot, but not my cousins. We try to get together every summer,</p><p>but sometimes we can&#39;t all make it. Vanessa:</p><p>That sounds like fun. What are your favorite things to do together as a family?</p><p>Dan: Well, we all love seeing</p><p>our kids play together, but all the adults like to play games too. We&#39;re all super competitive,</p><p>but we all have fun no matter who wins or loses. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh, that sounds so nice. Thanks for telling me about your family.</p><p>Hey, how was your get-together with your family? I know you were really looking forward to it.</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s great. How big is your family? Wow.

Dan:</p><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to decide. He really likes bowling, so I think we&#39;re going to do</p><p>a bowling party. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh. Well you can&#39;t strike out with that idea. All joking aside, do you need any help getting</p><p>the invitations ready? Dan:</p><p>That&#39;d be great. I&#39;m planning on passing them out this afternoon when we visit his friends</p><p>at the park. Vanessa:</p><p>Oh. Well, let&#39;s get started. Hey, you look busy.

Dan:</p><p>I do. Actually, a new Italian restaurant has opened up downtown.</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, that sounds wonderful. Do you have</p><p>any recommendations on what to order? Dan:</p><p>I&#39;ve heard the lasagna&#39;s really good, but the pizza also looks good. How about we try a little</p><p>of everything?
